    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>Attention workers: We have completed our evaluation of the plant. We regret to announce the following layoffs, which I will read in alphabetical order. Simpson, Homer. That is all. I want to share something with you. The three little sentences that will get you through life: Number 1: Cover for me. Number 2: Oh, good idea, Boss. Number 3: It was like that when I got here. And now to find out who did this... Bart, empty your pockets. So when I took the test the answers were stuck in my head. It was like a whole different kind of cheating. Im having the best day of my life and I owe it all to not going to Church. Welcome to <abbr title="Santa's Village">SV</abbr>, where it's Christmas everyday. Closed on Christmas. I think we'd be all better off if each country had its own planet.</p>
    <p>When I look at the smiles on all the children's faces, I just know they're about to jab me with something.</p>
    <p>If something's hard to do then it's not worth doing. I am so smart. I am so smart. S-M-R-T... I mean S-M-A-R-T. Books are useless. I only ever read one book -- To Kill a Mockingbird -- and it gave me absolutely no insight on how to kill mockingbirds. Sure it taught me not to judge a man by the color of his skin... but what good does that do me? Dad you've done a lot of great things, but you're a very old man and old people are useless. Homer no function beer well without. Mrs. Krabappel went to Idaho. Turns out the people sent to rescue her sister from a cult turned out to be an even worse cult. Young man, Eat my shorts. Lisa get in here... In this house we obey the laws of thermodynamics</p>
